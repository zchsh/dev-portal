  We want items to have space between them when on the same line,
  but we also want them to wrap to multiple lines when space is limited.
  We use a flex layout with some margin tricks to achieve this. Each CTA item
  Each item creates a buffer around it with margin, and the container offsets
  the "edges" of this buffer with negative margin.
  
  Note as well that margin does NOT collapse in flex layouts,
  which is why the item buffer is half the desired spacing.
